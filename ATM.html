                <h3>Reflection of the program</h3>
                   <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. Atm is a 3 year program at Bancroft middle school. Atm is a great program that has helped me with many things. Because  of the ATM program i have learned how to type without looking and to type with all my fingers.
